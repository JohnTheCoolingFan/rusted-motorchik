This is a rewrite of [Motorchik bot](https://github.com/JohnTheCoolingFan/Motorchik) to rust using [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) library

Invite link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=551085000775172096&permissions=8&scope=bot 

Admin privileges because I just don't know what exact permissions my bot would actually need (takes time to compile, I'm lazy, sorry).

The code is open source and this is my guarantee why you can safely give the bot admin priviliges. There is no arbitrary code execution that is hidden from source code, the bot running on the server is compiled from this exact source.

PLEASE report bugs, imperfections, suggest your feature requests, even the most crazy ones. That would help make a discord bot that doesn't suck and doesn't exploit you. Unlike *some* other bots.
