# Rusted Motorchik

This is a rewrite of my [Motorchik bot](https://github.com/JohnTheCoolingFan/Motorchik) in rust using [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) library

Invite link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=551085000775172096&permissions=1426399423606&scope=bot

The code is open source and this is my guarantee why you can safely use the bot with these permissions. There is no arbitrary code execution that is hidden from source code, the bot running on the server is compiled from this exact source.

To run the bot, build a binary and put it into a working dir, and launch with command `DISCORD_TOKEN="your-token-here" GUILD_CONFIG_HOME="guilds" rusted-motorchik` (don't forget to replace the token with yours). If you have any questions, open an issue on github.

PLEASE report bugs, imperfections, suggest your feature requests, even the most crazy ones. That would help make a discord bot that doesn't suck and doesn't exploit you. Unlike *some* other bots.
